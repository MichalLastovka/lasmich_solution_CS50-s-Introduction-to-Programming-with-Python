# Task:
# In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs 
# the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

m = int(input("Enter mass: "))
E = m * 300000000 ** 2
print(f"E: {E}")
