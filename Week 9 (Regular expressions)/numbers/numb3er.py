"""
Task:

In a file called numb3rs.py, implement a function called validate that expects an IPv4 address as input as a str and then returns True or False, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.

Structure numb3rs.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use re and/or sys.
